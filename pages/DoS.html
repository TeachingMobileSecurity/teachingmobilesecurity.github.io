    <h1>Denial of Service</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
        <p>
        A denial of service (DoS) attack is an incident in which a user or organization is deprived of the services of a resource they would normally expect to be able to access.
        In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), large numbers of compromised systems (sometimes called a botnet) attack a single target.
        </p>

        <p>
            This problem could affect the service your app uses and consequently, the users of your app as well.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This is because the number of automatic requests that are received by the server come from different usersâ€™ apps, like an automatic request to check for new data, or one to update the user location on the server.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Imagine that your app has 100,000 users.
            Consequently, there are large number of automatic requests going to the server every second.
            If the server cannot fulfil as many simultaneous requests, users are guaranteed to have an unplesant experience using the app.
