<h1>Developing a Secure App</h1>


<h3>Activity Overview</h3>
<p>
Your team has been hired to design, develop and evaluate a simple mobile application. In this team based activity, you will be responsible for A) Designing and creating a secure mobile app B) Evaluating another team's created software.
</p>


<h3>Application Overview</h3>
<p>Your team has been asked to create an Android app where a user can record the following information themselves:

<ol>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Address</li>
	<li>Grade on last report card</li>
	<li>Favorite color</li>
	<li>Favorite food</li>
	<li>Bank account balance</li>
</ol>

You may use any resources to complete this operation (Google, other students etc....). Id addition to being functional, the application should also be secure.
</p>


<h3>Activity Steps</h3>
<p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Create the requirements for the app, focusing on its security:</b> Secure software begins with secure requirements. You need to think about the proper procedures for designing your application. Think about if you were designing a bank or a castle from the ground up. You'd want to plan on making it secure right from the beginning. Even with the best implementation can be hurt with poor requirements and designing.</li>
	<li><b>Perform a self-assessment:</b> After you have completed each phase of the activity, you should perform a self-assessment using the provided <a href="gencyber/files/VulernabilityIdentification.docx" target="_blank">document</a>.</li>
<!--	<li><b>Design the app</b> XXXX</li> -->
	<li><b>Create the app:</b> Once you have designed the software, it will not be up to your team to create the secure application. Remember the principles we have been covering in the class.</li>
	<li><b>Refine the app:</b> Getting software correct from a functional, quality and security perspective can be very challenging task. You should incorporate the identified issues into your application to repair any discovered problems.</li>
</ol>

You will document all identified problems in the <a href="https://github.com/TeachingMobileSecurity/teachingmobilesecurity.github.io/blob/master/pages/gencyber/files/VulernabilityIdentification.docx" target="_blank">Vulnerability Assessment</a>.

</p>





<h3>Testing Another Team's Creation</h3>
<p>
One of the best ways to learn how to create secure software is to think like a hacker. How would someone with malicious intentions attempt to gain valuable information from your software? During each phase, it will be up to you to identify possible points of weakness. You should then share these with the other team. 
</p>



<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>
	The primary learning objectives of the activity are to:

<ul>
	<li>Understand that creating secure software can be an iterative process. It is very difficult to get correct the first time.</li>
	<li>Creating secure software takes larges amounts of thought, and planning. Frequently, the design can often be the most difficult part of creating secure software. While coding is important, it is only a small part of creating secure software.</li>
	<li>Performing a peer review of another team's software can be an effective mechanism for learning how to create your own software.</li>
