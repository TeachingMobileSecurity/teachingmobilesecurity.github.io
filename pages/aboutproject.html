	<h1>About Project</h1>


<p>We began this project in late 2015 in order to assist students and developers in learning more about common vulnerabilities, and how to create secure mobile software. During one of our security courses, we observed how difficult it was to create a robust, reusable set of security related activities. Our goal was to create a high-quality, reusable set of activities that could be used at other institutions from K-12 to university settings.</p>

	<p>
	All activities are currently targeted for the Android platform, although work is being done to create iOS activities. We are always looking for project contributors, so if you'd like to create an activity or provide feedback, please click <a href="index.html?page=contribute">here</a>.</p>
