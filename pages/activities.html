		<p>The Teaching Mobile Security project is comprised of separate course modules, which are designed to meet a wide range of experience levels ranging from new programmers, to seasoned mobile developers. In the following section, we will briefly detail each activity. A more thorough analysis may be found in the primary project <a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle" target="_blank">repository.</a></p>

		<p>These activities are designed for students just learning about mobile development or security.</p>


			

<ul>
<li><b><a href="index.html?page=PrivateInfo">Protecting Private Info:</a></b> You share a lot of data with the software that you use every day. However, do you ever think about this information that you are sharing? In this basic activity, particpants will be shown how easy it is for "sensative" information to be shared with tothers. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/PrivateInfo" target="_blank">Repo</a>]

<ul>
<li><b><a href="index.html?page=activitiesaccess">Activities Access:</a></b> Security issues arise when people try to access specific unauthorized activities. An example could be a bank app where users try to access a balance management activity without properly logging into the system. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/ActivitiesAccess" target="_blank">Repo</a>]
</li>


<li><b><a href="index.html?page=intentprotection">Intent Protection:</a></b> Android uses "Intents" to pass data between apps, for examples between the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps. Data passing between these apps may be easily (and improperly) read by other apps. This module explains how to protect information being sent via Intents between apps. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/Intent" target="_blank">Repo</a>]
</li>



<li><b><a href="index.html?page=xml" target="_blank">XML:</a></b> XML is very easy to read using reverse engineering. As a result, it is best to avoid saving important information, like Ads code or Map Code within XML files. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/XML" target="_blank">Repo</a>]
</li>

</ul>




<h2>Medium</h2>

<p>The following activities are designed for students and developers who have a fair amount of experience with mobile development. </p>



<ul>

    <li><b><a href="index.html?page=androidjavascript" target="_blank">Secure Webviews:</a></b> This demonstrates the negative implications of using JavaScript in Webview to pass data from an Android app to a server. This is considered bad practice because anyone could use malicious JavaScript code on their website to gain private user information associated with the app. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/AndroidJavascript" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>


	<li><b><a href="index.html?page=broadcast" target="_blank">Broadcast:</a></b> Broadcast data sent by the app is easy to access from any other app in the system. Because of this, the data broadcasted to specific apps should be encrypted. Intercepted unencrypted Broadcasts could lead to serious security and privacy issues. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/Broadcast" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>


	<li><b><a href="index.html?page=datastorage" target="_blank">Data Storage:</a></b> When an app does not secure stored data, like data files, shared references, and databases (i.e. SQLite), it has the potential to be read by any other app. This means that important information stored in these files (such as database connection information) should be encrypted. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/Data%20Storage" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>


	<li><b><a href="index.html?page=dataoverhttp" target="_blank">Data Over HTTP:</a></b> Data that moves over an unencrypted HTTP (Internet) connection is vulnerable to “Man in the Middle” attacks. One example of this is credit card information, which could be intercepted midstream, if sent over an unsecured connection. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/DataOverHTTP" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>


	<li><b><a href="index.html?page=DoS" target="_blank">DoS:</a></b> Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a common problem with Android, because a malicious party could create an overwhelming number of HTTP requests directed at a specific server. The environment must be managed to make them less vulnerable to these types of attacks. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/Dos" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>

    <li><b><a href="index.html?page=services" target="_blank">Services:</a></b> Services, particularly bound services, can be accessed by any app on a device if not properly protected. There must always be one or more ways of keeping a service secure and accessible only to apps we want trust. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/Services" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>


</ul>







<h2>Advanced</h2>

<p>These activities are intended to challenge even the most seasoned Android developers.</p>

<ul>


<li><b><a href="index.html?page=adlibraries" target="_blank">Ad Libraries:</a></b> In-app advertisements (“Ads”) libraries are able to use all of the permissions given to the app containing the Ads library. This is true as well for those who did not give these permissions to the Ads library itself. This can lead to various security and privacy issues within the app, including Ad libraries collecting sensitive user information such as locations or contact info. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/AdLibraries" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>

<li><b><a href="index.html?page=contentproviders" target="_blank">Content Providers</a></b>: Content providers share data between apps, and any app in the system can access the "Content_Providers" database. Because of this, data stored here must be kept secure and encrypted, so that it can only be read by an authorized app. [<a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle/tree/master/Vulnerabilities/Content_Providers" target="_blank">Repo</a>]</li>
