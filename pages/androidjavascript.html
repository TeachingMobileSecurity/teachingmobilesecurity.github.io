    <h1>Android Javascript</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
        We may want to have a web browser in our app to allow users to browse websites or display some content online.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Android API consists of a layout called WebView that enables you to display web pages.
        <br/>
        The web content displayed in the WebView may have Javascript alongside the HTML and CSS that make the page.
        Android also allows developers to have JavaScript within their website to write and read data to and from the phone.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This means that if we're not careful, anyone could gain access to the Javascript code that reads data from your device and use that in their website.
        This would allow them to gain access to app data and user data when a someone uses your app to visit their website.
