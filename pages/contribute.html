<h1>How to Contribute</h1>


<p>
We are always looking for new activities to share with other educators, students and developers. If you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to contact the <a href="index.html?page=aboutproject" >project owners</a>. When deciding upon a new activity to share in our project repository, among other things it should meet the following criteria:


<ol>
	<li><b>It should be interesting:</b> The activity should be engaging and spark excitement and interest to the user.</li>
	<li><b>It must be unambiguous:</b> The activity should be clearly written and contain clear and reproducible instructions how to:

	<ul>
		<li>Demonstrate the negative ramifications of the vulnerability.</li>
		<li>The mistakes that cause the vulnerability.</li>
		<li>What steps can be taken to test for the vulnerability.</li>
		<li>Proper defensive coding practices to limit the creation of the vulnerability.</li>
	</ul>

	</li>
	<li><b>It must be relevant: </b>Why should the student/developer care about this issue? Does it have a real-world impact?</li>
	<!--
