                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>
                    In an Android app, we can send data to a server over HTTP.
                    At times we are required to pass sensitive data such as a user's credentials to login into a web application.
                    <br/>
                    We may also have to send a user's device's location to determine where they are.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Keep in mind that this data moves over the web.
                    <br/>
                    When this data is in transit, it is very easy for a hacker to intercept it because it is sent over HTTP and it is not encrypted.
                    Anybody who can sniff packets could intercept and read this data so we must protect it.
