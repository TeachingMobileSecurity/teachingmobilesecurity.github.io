<h2>GenCyber Final Activity</h2>
<p>
During the camp, you have been exploring numerous types of vulnerabilities. As you've seen, vulnerabilities come in many shapes and forms. For the final activity, you will be examining an existing system for vulnerabilities and report on what you find. You will be evaluated on:

<ol>
	<li>Number of discovered vulnerabilities.</li>
	<li>Types of vulnerabilities discovered.</li>
	<li>Quality of documentation.</li>
	<li>Quality of presentation.</li>
</ol>

To start, you will be provided with a mobile app that may contain vulnerabilities. You should load this app inside of Android studio and examine it.
</p>

	

<h2>Presentation Resources</h2>

Documenting and presenting your findings is important in Cybersecurity research. In this activity, you will be asked to both document your findings in report format, along with a short presentation. You should use the following documents as starting points for your documentation, and should add to them as necessary.
