The Teaching Mobile Security project is comprised of separate course modules, which are designed to meet a wide range of experience levels ranging from new programmers, to seasoned mobile developers. In the following section, we will briefly detail each activity. A more thorough analysis may be found in the primary project <a href="https://github.com/dan7800/VulnerableAndroidAppOracle" target="_blank">repository</a>.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In Android, we can send data between apps quite easily. For example, when we want to share images on Facebook from a local app, we send the image to the Facebook app over the bundle. Then, the Facebook app reads the image data and posts it.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that sending data between apps can be insecure in Android. For example, Android will automatically export an Activity for other apps to use if certain requirements are met. See: the Android Developer Guide for more information on this.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
