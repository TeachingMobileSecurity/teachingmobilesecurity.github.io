<p>
This site presents public educational activities to assist in the instruction of both students and developers in creating secure Android apps. Our set of activities includes example vulnerable applications, information about each vulnerability, steps on how to repair the vulnerabilities, and information about how to confirm that the vulnerability has been properly repaired. Our goal is to make these activities available to other instructors for use in their classrooms ranging from K-12 to university settings. A secondary goal of this project is to  foster interest in security and computing.
</p>



<p>
These activities can be used at a wide range of venues including:

<ul>
	<li>Coding Camps</li>
	<li>Classrooms</li>
	<li>STEM Outreach Activities</li>
	<li>Workshops</li>

</ul>

<h4>Featured Activity: Secure Data Storage</h4>



<p>
When an app does not secure stored data, like data files, shared references, and databases (i.e. SQLite), it has the potential to be read by any other app. This means that important information stored in these files (such as database connection information) should be encrypted.
