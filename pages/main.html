<p>
This site presents a public educational activity to assist in the instruction of both students and developers in creating secure Android apps. Our set of activities includes example vulnerable applications, information about each vulnerability, steps how to repair the vulnerabilities, and information about how to confirm that the vulnerability has been properly repaired. Our goal is to make these activities available to other instructors for use in their classrooms ranging from the K-12 to university settings. A secondary goal of this project is that it also fosters interest in security, and computing.
</p>

	
<p>
These activities can be used at a wide range of venues including:

<ul>
	<li>Coding Camps</li>
	<li>Classrooms</li>
	<li>STEM Outreach activities</li>
	<li>Workshops</li>

</ul>
