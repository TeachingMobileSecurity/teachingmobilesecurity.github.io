<h1>Learning from Existing Mobile Vulnerabilities</h1>


<h3>Activity Overview</h3>
<p>
Understanding previous vulnerabilities is a great way to learn more about cybersecurity. In this activity, you will read about a previous mobile vulnerability and report on the following: 

<ul>


	<li>What was the vulnerability? (one paragraph)</li>
	<li>What caused it (from a <u>process</u> perspective)</li>
	<li>What caused it (from a <u>technical</u> perspective)</li>
	<li>What was the impact of the vulnerability?</li>
	<li>Who was impacted?</li>
	<li>How would you recommend for preventing it?</li>
	<li>What type of vulnerability was it?</li>
	<li>Does it have a CWE/CVE (provide link)</li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>

<h4>Resources for Historical Information</h4>
<p>
	
	The web is full of great resources for learning about previous vulnerabilities. A few are listed below:


	<li><b><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org" target="_blank">Common Weakness Enumeration</a></b>: CWE is a community-developed list of common software security weaknesses. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for software security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. </li>
	<li><b><a href="https://cve.mitre.org" target="_blank">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a></b>: CVE is a list of entries—each containing an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference—for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. </li>
	<li><b><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-1224/product_id-19997/Google-Android.html" target="_blank">Android CVE's</a></b>: List of current top CVE's for Android.</li>
	<li><b><a href="XXXXX" target="_blank">XXXXX</a></b>: XXXX </li>
	<li><b><a href="XXXXX" target="_blank">XXXXX</a></b>: XXXX </li>
	<li><b><a href="XXXXX" target="_blank">XXXXX</a></b>: XXXX </li>
	<li><b><a href="XXXXX" target="_blank">XXXXX</a></b>: XXXX </li>
