    <h1>Services</h1>


    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
        A Service is an application component that allows you to run long running operations in the background.
        This ensures that users can interact with another app and not have this service interrupt them.
        Another application component can bind to a service to interact with it.
        <br/>
        A service runs in its host process and does not create a thread of its own unless specified.
        Thus, if a service exposes a blocking operation or is expected to recieve multiple simultaneous requests
        it must be run in a separate thread.

        <p>
            You most likely have a service in action when you have one or more of these running in the background:
            <ul>
                <li>A file download</li>
                <li>An MP3 player playing your favourite song</li>
                <li>Writing to a database through a content provider</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


    <hr>
        Services in Android could be one of three types:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scheduled</strong> These can be scheduled using the JobScheduler API introduced with Android 5.0. The API has methods to
            maintain a queue to which services are added. These are then scheduled, by the system, based on the resource (network and time) requirements specified.</li>
            <li><strong>Started</strong></li> A service that is started by an application component, most likely an Activity within the same app. These services essentially
            perform just one background operation and do not generally return a result back to the calling Activity. These services need to stopped once they have finished the
            intended operation
            <li><strong>Bound</strong></li> A bound service offers a client-server interface for other application components to talk to it.
            It runs as long as a component is bound to it and is stopped when unbound.
        </ul>
    </p>



    <p>
        The security risk here is that apps that are not authorized to communicate with a service may be able to do so if the service hasn't been configured appropriately.
        An dangerous app could exploit a vulnerable service by obtaining it's package information. This information could be used to construct an explicit intent to bind to this service.
