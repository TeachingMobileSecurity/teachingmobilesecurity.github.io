<h1><center>XML</center></h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Android uses XML files to store static data, meaning that the data does not change through execution of the app. For example, translated strings (in languages such as English, Spanish, or Arabic) are stored in XML files for multi-language support. APK files are compressed files that contain many XML and Java files, making up the application.  Note that anyone could unzip the APK and read the data that was saved in XML. 
</p>

<p>
Many developers store important information in XML, such as an Ads number or a Google Maps API key. That is precarious, because someone who reverse engineers the app could read all the keys. The attacker could then use the stolen API key to obtain access to paid services, possibly running up high charges on the developer’s account.
